# Geometric control for multi-agent gradient learning dynamics

This project contains code for implementing disturbance decoupling concepts from geometric control on multi-agent gradient learning scenarios. 
## Multi-agent gradent learning models
1. Drone networks with configurable communication graphs
2. Tug-of-war LQ game

## Geometric control algorithms
1. Incentive generation to disturbance decouple two players
